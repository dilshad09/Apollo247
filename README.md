# Apollo247

# Hi, I'm Dilshad Ahmad
`I have cloned a website which is apollo247.com, It is a good website which is providing health services online as well as offline at the doorstep of needy people and people and take prescription with top Doctor of the world and can give the sample for the diagnosis at their doorstep. I am very happy to have this website for cloning, during the time of work on this project I faced a lot of challenges but they were like sweet pain for me because I learned a lot of thing after solving those problems. After completing my project now I am very happy because it was time bound project. And this journey taught me what is hard work with patient and resilience. I am ready for a new challenging task now. Thank you`
